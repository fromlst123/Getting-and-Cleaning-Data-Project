CodeBook
--------
This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

Data Source
-----------
This dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Data Information
----------------
The dataset includes the following files:

'README.txt'

'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

Getting and cleaning data
-------------------------
If the data is not already available in the data directory, it is downloaded from UCI repository.

The first step of the preprocessing is to merge the training and test sets. Two sets combined, there are 10,299 instances where each instance contains 561 features (560 measurements and subject identifier). After the merge operation the resulting data, the table contains 562 columns (560 measurements, subject identifier and activity label).

After the merge operation, mean and standard deviation features are extracted for further processing. Out of 560 measurement features, 33 mean and 33 standard deviations features are extracted, yielding a data frame with 68 features (additional two features are subject identifier and activity label).

Next, the activity labels are replaced with descriptive activity names, defined in activity_labels.txt in the original data folder.

The final step creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 10299 instances are split into 180 groups (30 subjects and 6 activities) and 66 mean and standard deviation features are averaged for each group. The resulting data table has 180 rows and 66 columns. The tidy data set is exported to Tidy.txt where the first row is the header containing the names for each column.
